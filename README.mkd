This is a super simple foundation for a redis client in Haskell.

to install the following should suffice

> git clone git://github.com/aconbere/RadisH.git
> cd Radish
> cabal install

At that point from ghci

> :m Redis
> r <- redis "127.0.0.1" 6379
> bulk r "SET" "key" (show 1234)
> getReply
Just (RedisString "OK")
> inline_query r "GET" "key"
Just (RedisString "1234")

Clearly this is sub optimal for general use, but the basics seem to work pretty well.
